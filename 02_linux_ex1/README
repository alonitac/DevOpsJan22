                                                      WhatIdo
                                                   ------------
The command 'strace', It is intercepts and records the system calls and the signals which are received by a process.
The 'whatIdo' script, It is about creating a Folder "welcomeToDevOpsJan22"
with a File name "goodLuck" which contains "There you go... tell me what I do..."

                                              Binary Numbers
                                             -----------------

<1.The following binary numbers to a decimals are : 111=7 , 100=4 , 10110=22>

<2.The available decimal range represented by a 8 bits binary number are : 0-255 in decimal.>

<3.The method I suggest is to present 0-255 in decimal is require 8 bits.
 Therefor, The 9-bit will represent the notions of positive and negative, respectively.
 0 as plus sign (+) | 1 as negative sign (-) >

<4.My suggestion to represent a floating point numbers using a 8-bits binary numbers is to replacing
  the dot in the middle, which will give us at max whole number 15. and at max float of 0.9375 >

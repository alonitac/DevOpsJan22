Kernel System Calls
-------------------
strace command show us what were the processes and internal commands the kernel asked from the cpu. in the last lines we can recognize our i/o requests. by strace we can assume where there are "bugs".


Binary Numbers
--------------
1. 111=7, 100=4, 10110=22,
2. 8 bits: 0 to 255
3. the MSB is the sign. so if MSB=0 this positive regular number: result= sum(LSB+n)
if MSB=1 this neg. no. so: result=-(sum(MSB+n))
4. I decided that the 6 left bits will be for integers, the 2 right bit for the fractions.
so the range of the integers will be 0 to 63 and the fractions with jumps of 0.25.
i think with 8 bits this method has the largest rang with good resolution of fractions.
for example: 10000001=32.25.

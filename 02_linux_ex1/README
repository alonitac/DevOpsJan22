Kernel System Calls
-------------------

the program create directory name "welcomeToDevOpsJan22" and in this folder it create a file name "goodLuck" in the file
there is a massage "There you go... tell me what I do..."

Binary Numbers
--------------
1)  a) 111=7
    b) 100=4
    c) 10110=22
2)0-255
3)if we look on 8 bits in binary as a positive number we can look at the 8 bits as 9 bits that start with the number 0
so if we look on 9 bits that start with 1 we can see it as a negative number
011111111=255
111111111=-255

4) if we a 16 bits number and we devided the 16 bits to 10 bits and 6 bits and put after the first bit "." the last 6 bits
will be the floating number.
12.3=1100.01001100110

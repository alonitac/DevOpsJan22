Kernel System Calls
-------------------
strace command - used for debugging programs.
in analyzes how a program interacts with the system in order to debug the executing of the program.
it returns the name of each system call (like a function) with its arguments inside a parenthesis
and return a value to standard error - will result 0 if the execute exited with no errors and -1 in case of an error.


Binary Numbers
--------------
1. Convert the following binary numbers to a decimals: 111, 100, 10110
1(1) + 1(2) + 1(4) = 7
0(1) + 0(2) + 1(4) = 4
0(1) + 1(2) + 1(4) + 0(8) + 1(16) = 22

2. What is the available decimal range represented by a 8 bits binary number?
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128

3. Given a 9 bits binary number, suggest a method to represent a negative numbers between 0-255
using a negative sign bit: 110010001
[1(1) + 0(2) + 0(4) + 0(8) + 1(16) + 0(32) + 0(64) + 1(128)] * (-1) = -145

4. Suggest a method to represent a floating point numbers (e.g. 12.3, 15.67, 0.231) using a 8 bits binary numbers
separate the binary number into two groups: 01111100
1 = 0111
2 = 1100
0111 = 7
1100 = 12
7B = 7.12

Kernel System Calls
-------------------
< First of all we change the permissions of the folder so that other users can only read the folder (700= 7=111=r , 0=w , 0=x.
 After that do strace the folder that it actually handy utility for tracing system, file, and network calls >

# FIXME (B) You were supposed to describe what the program "whatIdo" does, not what strace does



Binary Numbers
--------------
< 1.
    111 = 7
    100 = 4
    10110 = 22

  2.
    -1 , 225
    # FIXME (C) 0-255


  3.
    first bit will be negative and the other 8 bits will be numbers between 0,-255

  4.
    since we use 8 bits, the first bit is reserved for the sign : 0 = + , 1 = -.
    three bits are used for the biased exponent , and the remaining four bits are used for the significant.
    the method is : 2^(e-b) * c
    for example : we have the number 10111100
    the first bit is 1 so it is -
    011 = 2+1=3 so it is mean that (e-b) = 0 , becouse b is -3 .
    then the four last numbers 1=1 , 1=0.5 , 0=0.25 , 0=0.125
    so -2^(3-3) * 1.5 = 1.5

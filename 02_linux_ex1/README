Kernel System Calls
-------------------
The whatIdo file is kind of cryptographic in Ascii letters,but you can recognize message to the new student: welcome to the DevOps course Jan. 2022.
To decipher the file I used with Strace command that shows us what were the processes and internal commands the kernel asked from the cpu.
In the last lines we can recognize the data. By strace we can assume where there are "bugs" or data.

Binary Numbers
--------------
1. 111=7, 100=4, 10110=22.

2. 8 bits: 0 to 255

3. The MSB is the sign. so if MSB="0" this positive regular number: result= sum(2^n) when n from 0(Left) to 7(Right) only for "1"s
if MSB="1" this neg. no. so we calculate regularly but put minus sign before the result.

4. I decided that the 6 left bits will be for integers, the 2 right bit for the fractions.
so the range of the integers will be 0 to 63 and the fractions with jumps of 0.25.
I think with 8 bits this method has the largest rang with good resolution of fractions.
for example: 10000001=32.25.

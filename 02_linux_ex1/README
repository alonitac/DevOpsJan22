Kernel System Calls
-------------------
< stat("./welcomeToDevOpsJan22", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0700, st_size=22, ...}) = 0
The command creates a local directory with the name: "welcomeToDevOpsJan22"
which it has the size of 22 byte and 700 permission.
Inside that directory it creates a file with the name: "goodLuck"
and permission 644.
Then the next line writes into the file the line:
"There you go... tell me what I do..."
and exits with exit status 0. >


Binary Numbers
--------------
<
 1. 100 - 4
    111 - 7
    10110 - 22
 2. The range is 0-255, 2^8 zero counts.
 3. Given a 9 bits binary number, suggest a method to represent a negative numbers between 0-255
 the accepted method usually leaving the left bit when 0 is positive and 1 is negative for example
 the number 223 = 0 + 0 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 0 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 if we shall put it into binary we'll get
 223 = 0011011111 there for -223 = 1011011111 and the left digit is for negative sign

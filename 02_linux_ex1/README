Kernel System Calls
-------------------
The whatIdo program does the following:

creates a folder welcomeToDevOpsJan22 with 700 permissions (drwx------)
creates a file goodLuck inside the folder and set the permissions to 664 (-rw-rw-r--)
insert the following text into a file: "There you go... tell me what i do..."
exit the program

Binary Numbers
--------------
1.Convert the following binary numbers to a decimals: 111, 100, 10110 :

111 = 7 (1+2+4)
100 = 4 (0+0+4)
10110 = 22 (0+2+4+0+16)

2.What is the available decimal range represented by a 8 bits binary number?

0-255 (256 numbers)

3.Given a 9 bits binary number, suggest a method to represent a negative numbers between 0-255 :

negative numbers always starts with 1 (-182 = 1111 1111 0100 1010 = 101001010 )
positive numbers always starts with 0 ( 182 = 0000 0000 1011 0110 = 010110110 )

(The simplest way represent negative numbers is to simply use the leftmost digit of the number as a special value to represent the sign of the number:
0 = positive 1 = negative. For example, a value of positive 12 would be written as 01100 in binary, but negative 12 would be written as 11100.
a different way, called "two's complement" is more often used for representing negative numbers. In this way, a positive 12 is still 01100,
but -12 would be written as 10100. Either 11100 or 10100 can be used to represent -12, it just depends on what system of interpretation is used.)

4.Suggest a method to represent a floating point numbers (e.g. 12.3, 15.67, 0.231) using a 8 bits binary numbers

12.3 = 1100.01001100 in 8 bits 1100.0100
15.67 = 1111.10101011 in 8 bits 1100.1010
0.231 = 0.00111011

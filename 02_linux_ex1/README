Binary Numbers

< Your Answer >
1.  1*4 1*2 1*1 = 7
1*4 0*2 0*1 = 4
1*16 + 0*8 + 1*4 + 1*2 + 0*1 = 22

2. 0-255

# FIXME (B) in both 3-4 you should suggest some method to represent negative and decimal numbers. e.g. to represent negative numbers the first bit can represent the sign. 0 for positive, 1 to negative

3. 1* -256 0*128 0*64 1*32 0*16 1*8 0*4 1*2 1*1 = -213
100101011 = -213

4. 12.3 =1100.01001100
    15.67 = 1111.10101011
    0.231 = 0.00111011

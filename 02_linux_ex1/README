Binary Numbers
--------------
<1. 111=7 100=4 10110=22
 2. 8 bit max range- 0-255
 3.if the firs bit is a 0 than its positive number, and if the first bit is a 1 than it is a negative number
 4.Mantissa is calculated from the remaining 23 bits of the binary representation. It consists of ‘1’ and a fractional part
  for ex- 1001: 1*(1/2)+0*(1/4)+0*(1/8)+1*(1/16)=0.625>

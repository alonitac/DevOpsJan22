Kernel System Calls
-------------------
The first command: wget https://devops-jan22.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/whatIdo retrieves a file ("whatIdo")
then, using the chmod command we give "whatIdo" permission to be executed.
The strace command allows for listing general or specific system calls,
which are the basis of software to kernel interaction.
By running <strace ./whatIdo> we get a list of system calls made by the file,
which include memory allocation, accessing and opening libraries,
and the creation of the directory: ./welcomeToDevOpsJan22
then the message "There you go... tell me what I do" is directed to be printed and the program terminates.

Binary Numbers
--------------
1.  111 = 7
    100 = 4
    10110 = 22
2.  2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 = 255
    hence the range of a decimal number represented by an 8 bit binary is 0-255
3.  We already know that with an 8 bit binary we can represent any number between 0-255.
    Given a 9th we can determine whether the number is either 0=positive or 1=negative.
    The number 241 in binary is 11110001.
    By adding 0 to the left we can determine that 0|11110001=241. while 1|11110001=-241.
4.  For the purpose of representing floating point numbers in binary there exists a
    method that uses the mantissa and an exponent. Any floating point number can be
    the product of another, shorter, floating point number multiplied by something.
    In binary the value 2 is the base. So for example the number 8.88=1.11x2^3. Here
    1.11 is the mantissa, and 3 is the exponent. The way this is implemented in binary
    is that the first number on the left determines the natural number 1 or 0,
    the next four the mantissa, and the last three the exponent. So 8.88 = 1|1011|011.

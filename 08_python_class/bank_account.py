"""
Create a bank account class that has two attributes:

* owner
* balance

and two methods:

* deposit
* withdraw

As an added requirement, withdrawals may not exceed the available balance.
Instantiate your class, make several deposits and withdrawals, and test to make sure the account can't be overdrawn.

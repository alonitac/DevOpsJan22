Git Basics

1. Red
2. green
3. blue
4. get diff main (master)
5 . because i have not added abc.txt to the index
6. git diff stage2 is and invalid command.
7. gitt diff prints nothing because there is no difference present between working
copy and the index .
8. git diff --staged
No git diff staged  will compare index and master on the other hand,
git diff main will also compare the changes done in working copy
9. one line will represent changes that are committed and the other will represent
changes that are not staged for commit.

Resolve conflicts:
yes there are new commits by jhon and nadella :
bugfix/fix_readme_typo
  bugfix/open_kibana_port
  dev
  feature/data_retention_policy
  feature/elasticsearch_helm_chart
  feature/lambda_migration
  feature/upgrade_angular_version
  feature/version1
  feature/version2
* main
  reset_question

Cherry picking
1. files by the name of .env and config.json have been added.
2. yes because the first commit may create a file that is later will be updated by the 2nd commit and apply changes.
vice versa will not work (common logic )

Changes in working tree and switch branches
1. there is smart checkout and force checkout and don't checkout.
2. no.
3. no, the new file with some new lines is not in the previous branch.
 Force Checkout, is removing any uncommitted changes.

 resetting:

git reset soft:
 uncommitted changes, changes are left staged (index).
 file 10 is in  uncommitted stage.
git reset mixed:
(default): uncommitted + unstage changes, changes are left in working tree.
the files 9 and 10 are red and they are untracked
git reset hard:
 uncommitted + unstage + delete changes, nothing left
 file 8 is removed
git revert HEAD~1:
Revert changes.
file 6 is removed and change commited.

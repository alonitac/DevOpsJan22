Git Basics

1. Red
2. green
3. blue
4. get diff main (master)
5 . because i have not added abc.txt to the index
6. git diff stage2 is and invalid command.
7. gitt diff prints nothing because there is no difference present between working
copy and the index .
8. git diff --staged
No git diff staged  will compare index and master on the other hand,
git diff main will also compare the changes done in working copy
9. one line will represent changes that are committed and the other will represent
changes that are not staged for commit.

Cherry picking
1. files by the name of .env and config.json have been added.
2. yes because the first commit may create a file that is later will be updated by the 2nd commit and apply changes.
vice versa will not work (common logic )

Changes in working tree and switch branches
1. there is smart checkout and force checkout
2. yes, Branch Dev has the new file with changes.
3. no, the new file with some new lines is not in the previous branch.
 Force Checkout, is transferring the new changes to the other branch by force.

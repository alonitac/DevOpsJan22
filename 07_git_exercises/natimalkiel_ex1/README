### Git Basics

1.	cat > abc.txt
2.	Red
3.	Green
4.	echo '2' >> abc.txt
5.	gray
6.	git status
7.	because we didnâ€™t add the file to the stage area yet by git add
8.	because stage2 is not a branch
9.	git add abc.txt
10.	nothing, there is no changes.
11.	git diff main
12.	echo '3' >> abc.txt
13.	no, the "git diff --staged" show what is in the working directory. And the git diff main show the recent changes to the file "+3".
14.	Because git tells us that we have one file that is not yet added (2) and one file that is not tracked (3)
15.	git reset abc.txt
